"""GitHub issues for the cards a format plays, and who is working on which.

    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py sync <format> [--dry-run] [--limit N]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py next <format> [-n 5] [--json]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py claim "Card Name" ["Other Card" ...]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py claim --format <format> [-n 1]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py release "Card Name" ["Other Card" ...]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py status
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py log <N> <event> [--commit SHA | --findings N | --rule CR]
    python tools/maintenance/card-issues.py times [--days 30]

The cards a format plays are docs/formats/<format>.json, best-played first (format-scrape.py makes it). Each card
that has no card file yet is one issue, "Card: <Name>", labelled `card`, `format:<format>` (a card several formats
play has several) and a `priority:` label for how much of the format plays it. `sync` makes the issues that are
missing, labels the ones that exist, and closes those whose card now has a file. Run it again after a new scrape.

A claim is a comment on the issue ("Claimed by @you"), because the people who work on cards cannot all be assigned
to or label an issue. A claim holds for 24 hours from the last sign of work, and then the card is free for anyone:

    - a renewal (the claim command again, by the holder);
    - a commit on an open pull request that closes the issue ("Closes #N" in its description) or is from a branch
      named card/<slug>; a pull request itself is a claim by its author;
    - a push to a branch named card/<slug> in this repository, for work with no pull request.

The earliest live claim wins: `claim` posts its comment, reads the issue again, and says so when someone else's claim
came first. A claimant is a GitHub account and a checkout: the comment names the checkout (`--as`, else
$CANTRIP_CLAIMANT, else the checkout's directory name), so two agents working under one account in their own
worktrees hold cards apart and never take the same one. Pushes and pull requests carry only the account, and renew
the live claim of any checkout of that account. `next` lists what can be taken - issues nobody holds live - in the format's order; `claim` on a card
with no issue opens the issue first, then claims it. Commit messages and pull request descriptions of a card say
`Closes #N`, so the issue closes when it lands.

The repository is origin's (--repo owner/name to override); gh is the GitHub client and must be signed in.
