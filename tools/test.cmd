rem Wall-clock tests wait on real time: the browser tests (Cantrip.Client.Web.Tests),
rem and the tests marked [Trait("Category", "WallClock")] - real sockets, the
rem Discord bot's tables, whole events played by bots. Run them when the work
rem touches what they cover (/filter "Category=WallClock&FullyQualifiedName~Pod",
rem say, or /all), not as a habit.
rem
rem The browser tests are not a nicety. They run the web client as a player gets
rem it - the WebAssembly build, served, in Chrome, over a real WebSocket - and
rem play one whole game in it and draw every prompt dock. Their pictures go under TestResults\web. They
rem take the installed Chrome or Edge; see dotnet\tests\Cantrip.Client.Web.Tests.
rem
rem Exits non-zero if the build or any test fails, and always ends with one
rem verdict line: "All tests passed (1,262 .NET, 8,849 engine, 3 skipped).",
rem "Tests failed (...)." or "Build failed. No tests ran." Read that line, not
rem the tail of the output - and beware piping this through `tail`, which hands
rem back its own exit code.
rem
rem The output is captured and only what a passing run does not print is shown
rem (failures, errors, panics, anything unrecognised: tools\maintenance\
rem test-report.ps1), so a pass is the verdict line alone. /detailed streams
rem everything as it runs, each test listed.
