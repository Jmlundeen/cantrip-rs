/// that follows (CR 701.24) puts in a random order anyway; the creature cards found leave it for the battlefield as one
/// event (CR 608.2c). "Those permanents" are the ones that entered: a card a replacement sent elsewhere (Containment
/// Priest's exile) or a rule kept where it was (Weathered Runestone) is not one, so it is not goaded, no opponent is chosen

/// permanent it is on, should that leave the battlefield (CR 400.7) - the control change comes after it, so it is still the
/// ability's controller who goads, and one opponent each, never the same one twice, receives them. Each choice names the
