//! Whether a triggered ability looks back in time (CR 603.10) is read partly from its own words (`read_zone_words`): "from
//! anywhere" (CR 603.6c) and a card leaving a graveyard (CR 603.10a), which its trigger event can't show. Those words are
//! the ability's `text`, written in its card's file, so this test holds them to the card's Oracle text (`CardDef::text`,
//! generated from its JSON): each of the two is said by one of a card's triggered abilities exactly when the card's Oracle
//! text has a trigger condition that says it - its own lines, the abilities it grants in quotes, and its reminder text.
