//! Judging a declaration of attackers (CR 508.1a-d): one validator for every restriction, requirement and cost a
//! declaration answers to, from the rules the question holds (`AttackRules`, beside the attackers that may attack, what they
//! may attack and what attacks cost). `AttackRules::judge` says whether a declaration may be made as it is
//! (`AttackVerdict::complete`), why not (`AttackVerdict::issue`), what it costs, and which attacks may be added to it on the
//! way to one that may (`AttackVerdict::addable`). The core checks every answer with it, the scenario harness reads it, and
//! the host gives its verdict to a client as its player declares (`CheckAttacks`), so no client works CR 508.1d out.
//!
//! CR 508.1d counts requirements: the declaration must obey as many as any declaration that obeys every restriction can
//! without paying a cost. A goaded creature (CR 701.15b) is under two for each player who goaded it - attack, and attack a
//! player other than that one - and "attacks that player this combat if able" is one: attacking either of two players may
//! obey as many as the other, and both are legal. A restriction on one attacker at a time (who may attack, and what) leaves
//! the most each attacker's best attack, added up; a cap on how many may attack one player, planeswalker or battle (CR
//! 508.1c) is room the attackers share, which makes the most a maximum-weight assignment with capacities (`Assignment`), solved
//! exactly in polynomial time.
