//! Class levels (CR 716): "{cost}: Level N" is an activated ability, activated only as a sorcery and only while the Class
//! is level N-1 (CR 716.2b); when it resolves the Class becomes level N (CR 716.3). The level is a designation, never a
//! counter, and a Class that has none is level 1 (CR 716.2a). Does Machines, Innkeeper's Talent, Stormchaser's Talent and
//! Caretaker's Talent print it.
