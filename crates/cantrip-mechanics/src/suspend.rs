//! Suspend (CR 702.62a): "Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay [cost] and exile it with N time
//! counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter from it. When the last is removed, cast it
//! without paying its mana cost." Lotus Bloom and Rift Bolt print it.
//!
//! A card with suspend sets `suspend: Some(SuspendDef { count, cost })` and lists `ability(cost, text)`: the special
//! action (CR 116.2) of exiling it from the hand whenever it could be cast. Printing suspend gives the card the keyword
//! (`Keyword::Suspend`, `CardDef::printed_keywords`); a card that gains suspend (Delay, Epochrasite) is given it by an effect
//! (`EffectKind::AddKeywords`). Either way the layers give an object with the keyword suspend's two triggered abilities,
//! which function in exile (`cantrip_api::intrinsic::SUSPEND_UPKEEP`, `SUSPEND_CAST`), and so is the haste a creature spell
//! cast by the second gains until its caster loses control of it (`intrinsic::SUSPEND_HASTE`, carried to the permanent it
//! becomes, CR 400.7a).
