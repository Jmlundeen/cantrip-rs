//! Gift (CR 702.174): "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may choose an opponent" (CR 702.174a), and the
//! gift that opponent receives. Dawn's Truce (a card) and Into the Flood Maw (a tapped Fish) print it on instants.
//!
//! The core owns the cost and its timing: the promise and the opponent are announced before the targets (CR 601.2b,
//! 702.174m), and an instant or sorcery gives its gift as it resolves, before its other effects (CR 702.174j), and not at
//! all if it is countered or all its targets are illegal (CR 608.2b). A card with gift gives one of the constants here as
//! its `gift`; "if the gift was promised" is `item.gift.is_some()`, and `promised` reads it for a target filter
//! (`q.obj(asker.source).gift`, the spell on the stack).
//!
//! A permanent with gift lists `trigger(text)` among its `abilities`: "When this permanent enters, if its gift cost was
//! paid, [gift]" (CR 702.174b). A token a gift creates is listed in the card's `EXTRA` (`tokens::FISH`, ...).
