//! Paradigm (CR 702.192a): "If this is the first time a spell you control with this spell's name has resolved this game, at the

//!
//! A card with paradigm sets `paradigm: Some(paradigm::SPELL_ABILITY)`, which the core runs after the card's own effect (and
//! then exiles the spell as it leaves the stack), and lists `paradigm::TRIGGER` first among its `delayed` abilities. The
//! delayed triggered ability is no ability of the card: it is made as the spell resolves and lasts for the rest of the game,
//! whatever happens to the card in exile, and each copy is of the spell as it resolved (the rulings: "Once a spell with
//! paradigm has resolved, it doesn't matter what happens to the card in exile. Even if the card leaves exile, the delayed
//! triggered ability will still trigger during each of your first main phases, and the copy will still be created.").
